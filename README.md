# Mimir

A simple and lightweight Bash script designed to automate the processing of audiobook ZIP files. When a ZIP file is uploaded to a designated "staging" directory, this script automatically unzips it, moves the audio files to a primary library, and deletes the original archive to save space.

This script is built using `inotify-tools` to reliably trigger the process only after a file transfer is complete, preventing race conditions and file corruption.

If you plan to use this, make sure you set the paths to be relevant to you and your setup.

- Added lock-file checking to prevent fork-bombing myself ðŸ˜’
- Logging added to help debug the annoying nonsense
- Added an organiser script; will integrate eventually.
- Better logging
